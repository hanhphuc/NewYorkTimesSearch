This is an Android demo application for displaying the latest Instagram Photo Viewer [Instagram API].

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular Parceler library
 * [x] Required: Robust error handling, check if internet is available, handle error cases, network failures.
 * [x] Required: custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
 
 
Notes:

Spent some time making the UI work across multiple phone resolutions by playing around with the RelativeLayout and LinearLayout .
